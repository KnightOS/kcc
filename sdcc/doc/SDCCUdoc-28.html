<P>SDCC is a large project , the compiler alone (without the Assembler Package
, Preprocessor &amp; garbage collector) is about 40,000 lines of code (blank
stripped). As with any project of this size there are bound to be bugs, I am
more than willing to work to fix these bugs , of course all the source code
is included with the package. 
<P>Where does it go from here ? I am planning to target the Atmel AVR 8-bit
MCUs which seems to have a lot of users. I am also planning to include an alias
analysis system with this compiler (it does not currently have one).
