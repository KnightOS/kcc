Welcome to SDCC, a freeware, retargettable, optimizing ANSI C compiler
that supports a growing list of processors including the Intel mcs51
family, the Zilog Z80, and the ds390.

See share/doc/sdcc/INSTALL.txt for the installation instructions for
the binary kits.

See the share/doc/sdcc directory for more documentation.

See http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ for the latest information on sdcc.
