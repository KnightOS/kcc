Welcome to SDCC, a freeware, retargettable, optimizing ANSI C compiler
that supports a growing list of processors including the Intel mcs51
family, the Zilog z80 and the Maxim ds390.

See share/sdcc/doc/INSTALL.txt for the installation instructions for
the binary kits.

See the share/sdcc/doc directory for more documentation.

See http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ for the latest information on sdcc.

this license covers the code to the compiler and other executables,
but explicitly does not cover any code or objects generated by sdcc.
We have not yet decided on a license for the run time libraries, but
