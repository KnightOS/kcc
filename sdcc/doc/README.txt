SDCC - free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler
------------------------------------------------------------------

SDCC 3.1.0 release is dedicated to the memory of Dennis M. Ritchie,
father of the C programming language.

Welcome to SDCC, free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI C
compiler that supports a growing list of processors including the
Intel 8051, Maxim 80DS390, Zilog Z80, Z180, Rabbit 2000, gbz80,
Motorola 68HC08, Microchip PIC16 and PIC18 targets.

See share/sdcc/doc/INSTALL.txt for the installation instructions for
the binary kits.

See the share/sdcc/doc directory for more documentation.

See http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ for the latest information on sdcc.


License:
SDCC is licensed under the GNU Public license (GPL) v2.  Note that
this license covers the code to the compiler and other executables,
but explicitly does not cover any code or objects generated by sdcc.
The great majority of sdcc run time libraries are licensed under
GPLv2+LE which allows linking of sdcc run time libraries with
proprietary (closed source) applications.

Exception are pic device libraries and header files which are derived
from Microchip header (.inc) and linker script (.lkr) files. Microchip
requires that "The header files should state that they are only to be
used with authentic Microchip devices" which makes them incompatible
with GPL. Pic device libraries and header files are located at
non-free\lib and non-free\include directories respectively. Sdcc should
be run with the --use-non-free command line option in order to include
non-free header files and libraries.

Notes:
* The ds400, pic14 and pic16 are currently experimental, but work is in
progress. Please check http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/snap.php for snapshots.
* The TININative, avr and xa51 targets are no longer maintained.
