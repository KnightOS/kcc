<P>SDCC is a Free ware , retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler. The current
version targets Intel 8051 based MCUs, it can be retargetted for other 8 bit
MCUs or PICs. The entire source code for the compiler is distributed under
GPL. SDCC used ASXXXX &amp; ASLINK a Free ware, retargettable assembler &amp;
linker. SDCC has extensive MCU (8051) specific language extensions, which lets
it utilize the underlying hardware effectively. The front-end (parser) will
be enhanced to handle language extensions for other MCUs as and when they are
targetted. In addition to the MCU Specific optimizations SDCC also does a host
of standard optimizations like global sub expression elimination, loop optimizations
(loop invariant, strength reduction of induction variables and loop reversing),
constant folding &amp; propagation, copy propagation, dead code elimination
and jumptables for 'switch' statements. For the back-end SDCC uses a global
register allocation scheme which should be well suited for other 8 bit MCUs
, the peep hole optimizer uses a rule based substitution mechanism which is
MCU independent. Supported data-types are short (8 bits, 1 byte), char (8 bits,
1 byte), int (16 bits, 2 bytes ), long (32 bit, 4 bytes) &amp; float (4 byte
IEEE). The compiler also allows inline assembler code to be embedded anywhere
in a function. In addition routines developed in assembly can also be called.
SDCC also provides an option to report the relative complexity of a function,
these functions can then be further optimized , or hand coded in assembly if
need be. SDCC also comes with a companion source level debugger SDCDB, the
debugger currently uses S51 a freeware simulator for 8051, it can be easily
modified to use other simulators. The latest version can be downloaded from

<P>All packages used in this compiler system are opensource (freeware); source
code for all the sub-packages ( asxxxx assembler/linker , pre-processor and
gc a conservative garbage collector) are distributed with the package. Documentation
was created using a freeware word processor (LyX).
