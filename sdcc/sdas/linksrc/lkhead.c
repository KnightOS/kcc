/*Module	lkhead.c
 *
 *	The module lkhead.c contains the function newhead() which
 *	creates a head structure and the function module() which
 *	loads the module name into the current head structure.
 *
 *	lkhead.c contains the following functions:
 *		VOID	newhead()
 *		VOID	module()
 *
 *	lkhead.c contains no local variables.
 */

/*)Function	VOID	newhead()
 *
 *	The function newhead() creates a head structure.  All head
 *	structures are linked to form a linked list of head structures
 *	with the current head structure at the tail of the list.
 *
 *	local variables:
 *		int	i		evaluation value
 *		head *	thp		temporary pointer
 *					to a header structure
 *
 *	global variables:
 *		area	*ap		Pointer to the current
 *					area structure
 *		lfile	*cfp		The pointer *cfp points to the
 *					current lfile structure
 *		head	*headp		The pointer to the first
 *					head structure of a linked list
 *		head	*hp		Pointer to the current
 *					head structure
 *
 *	functions called:
 *		a_uint	expr()		lkeval.c
 *		VOID *	new()		lksym.c
 *		VOID	lkparea()	lkarea.c
 *
 *	side effects:
 *		A new head structure is created and linked to any
 *		existing linked head structure.  The head structure
 *		parameters of file handle, number of areas, and number
 *		of global symbols are loaded into the structure.
 *		The default area "_abs_" is created when the first
 *		head structure is created and an areax structure is
 *		created for every head structure called.
