/*)S19 Format
 *      Record Type Field    -  This  field  signifies  the  start  of a
 *                              record and  identifies  the  the  record
 *                              type as follows:  
 *
 *                                  Ascii S1 - Data Record 
 *                                  Ascii S9 - End of File Record 
 *
 *      Record Length Field  -  This  field  specifies the record length
 *                              which includes the  address,  data,  and
 *                              checksum   fields.   The  8  bit  record
 *                              length value is converted to  two  ascii
 *                              characters, high digit first.  
 *
 *      Load Address Field   -  This  field  consists  of the four ascii
 *                              characters which result from  converting
 *                              the  the  binary value of the address in
 *                              which to begin loading this record.  The
 *                              order is as follows:  
 *
 *                                  High digit of high byte of address. 
 *                                  Low digit of high byte of address.  
 *                                  High digit of low byte of address.  
 *                                  Low digit of low byte of address.  
 *
 *                              In an End of File record this field con-
 *                              sists of either four ascii zeros or  the
 *                              program  entry  address.   Currently the
 *                              entry address option is not supported.  
 *
 *      Data Field           -  This  field consists of the actual data,
 *                              converted to two ascii characters,  high
 *                              digit first.  There are no data bytes in
 *                              the End of File record.  
 *
 *      Checksum Field       -  The  checksum  field is the 8 bit binary
 *                              sum of the record length field, the load
 *                              address field, and the data field.  This
 *                              sum is then  complemented  (1's  comple-
 *                              ment)   and   converted   to  two  ascii
 *                              characters, high digit first.
