SDCC - free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI-C compiler
------------------------------------------------------------------

SDCC 3.1.0 release is dedicated to the memory of Dennis M. Ritchie,
father of the C programming language.

Welcome to SDCC, free open source, retargettable, optimizing ANSI C compiler
that supports a growing list of processors including the Intel 8051,
Maxim 80DS390, Zilog Z80, Z180, Rabbit 2000, Motorola 68HC08 and the
PIC16 and PIC18 familiy.

See share/sdcc/doc/INSTALL.txt for the installation instructions for
the binary kits.

See the share/sdcc/doc directory for more documentation.

See http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/ for the latest information on sdcc.
