Small Device C Compiler (sdcc)
------------------------------
A C compiler for the Intel mcs51 series and soon the Z80.

http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

This file is just a stub.  It will get better.

Almost all of this is by Sandeep Dutta <sandeep.dutta@usa.net>
The Z80 port was started by Michael Hope <michaelh@earthling.net>

Some of the Z80 related files are borrowed from the Gameboy
Development Kit (GBDK) originally by Pascal Felber.

Notes:
------
000123 mlh: You can set the processor type at run time.  Try:
sdcc -mz80 blah.c
sdcc -mmcs51 blah.c

The default is the mcs51.

Roadmap:
--------
README		- This file
COPYING		- GPL v2
as/		- Assembler, derrived from asxxxx
debugger/
device/		- Device libraries and examples
doc/		- sdcc and port specific documentation
link/		- Linker, also derrived from asxxxx
sim/		- Simulator (mcs51 only)
src/		- Source to the C compiler and ports
support/	- Libraries and apps that may not be provided by your system.

Most of the port related files are in a subdirectory below the
appropriate module.  For example, all compiler z80 related files
are in src/z80, all 8051 (mcs51) specific library files are in
device/lib/mcs51.
