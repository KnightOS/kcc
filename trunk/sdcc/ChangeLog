    aomf51 file: aslink.h, lkdta.c, lklex.c, lklibr.c, lklist.c,
    lkmain.c.  Also added: lkmem.c and lkaomf51.c.  Changed the 
    following files to include the previous two files: aslink.dsp,
    Makefile.aslink, Makefile.bcc, and Makefile.in.

    * Changed \sdcc\src\SDCCmain.c so it creates files with extension
    .adb instead of .cdb
    
2002-11-09  Jesus Calvino-Fraga <jesusc@ece.ubc.ca>

	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\lklist.c: Now reports memory usage using the
	value from option --iram-size.

2002-09-20  Jesus Calvino-Fraga <jesusc@ece.ubc.ca>

	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\lklist.c: added boundary check before using
	dram[] array.

2002-09-18    <wiml@hhhh.org>

	* SDCClrange.h: exposed setFromRange() and setToRange()
	* mcs51/ralloc.c: fixed over-eager packRegsForSupport() and
	  packRegsForAccUse() (bug 542397)
	* mcs51/gen.c: MOVA() is now a function to avoid calling aopGet()
	  multiple times and emitting the fetch operations more than once
	  added aopGetUsesAcc() function to allow binary operators to
	  fetch their operands in the correct order; made genMinus() emit
	  compact code for X = LITERAL - Y 

2002-09-00  Jesus Calvino-Fraga <jesusc@ece.ubc.ca>
	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\lklist.c: Fixed incorrect number of parameters to
	sprintf() in line 1267.

2002-09-08  Jesus Calvino-Fraga <jesusc@ece.ubc.ca>
	* \sdcc\src\SDCCglue.c: Generate areas REG_BANK_[0-3] only for 8051
	like ports.

2002-09-04  Jesus Calvino-Fraga <jesusc@ece.ubc.ca>
	Changes to aslink (All the changes are marked with 'JCF'):

	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\aslink.h: External definition of sflag and
	summary().

	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\lkarea.c: Computes the size of area BSEG_BYTES from
	area BSEG.  Also moves, if possible, the DATA area down into the internal
	ram so more space is available.

	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\lkdata.c: Definition of memory summary output flag
	sflag.

	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\lklist.c: For the BSEG area report the size in bits,
	not bytes.  Function summary() which creates a memory usage summary
	file with extension .mem.  Reports of overlaping stack and small stack
	size.  If the space for the stack is less than 16 bytes aslink trows a
	warning.
	
	* \sdcc\as\mcs51\lkmain.c: Creation of some of the default areas for
	the 8051.  Option 'y' for memory summary output file.

	Changes to sdcc (All the changes are marked with 'JCF'):

	* \sdcc\src\SDCCglobl.h: External definition of RegBankUsed[4].

	* \sdcc\src\SDCCglue.c:  If a register bank is used, creates an
	overlaying area	for it (uses RegBankUsed[4]).

	* \sdcc\src\SDCCmain.c: Definition RegBankUsed[4]; marks register
	bank zero as used by default.  By default aslink locates the stack
	(equivalent to --stack-after-data).  Pass option 'y' to aslink for
	the creation of the .mem file.  Delegates the allocation of data area
	to aslink (it is not longer 0x30 by default).  If --stack-loc passes
	the begining of the stack area to aslink.

	* \sdcc\src\SDCCmem.c:  If a register bank is used, marks it so
	glue() in SDCCglue.c creates an area for it.
	
2002-09-03  Borut Razem <borut.razem@siol.net>
	* sdcc/src/SDCCglue.c, sdcc/src/SDCCglue.h, sdcc/src/SDCCmain.c,
	sdcc/src/pic/glue.c:
	introduced atexit() handler for teporay files removal in case of
	errors, assertions, ...

2002-08-29  Borut Razem <borut.razem@siol.net>
	* sdcc/support/cpp2/auto-host_vc_in.h:
	re-definition of O_BINARY and other O_XXX as _O_BINARY and _O_XXX, so the problem
	with the returned value from read() in sdcc/support/cpp2/cppfiles.c is solved for MSC.
	Maybe there is a similar problem with BORLANDC? It should be checked!

	* sdcc/src/ds390/ralloc.c, sdcc/src/mcs51/ralloc.c, sdcc/src/z80/ralloc.c:
	corrected improper use of assert: the assignment to clr variable was done inside the assert.
	In case that NDEBUG was defined, the assert macro was substituted with no-op, so the assignment
	was not executed, and the compiler (cl) launched a warning:
	ralloc.c(1442) : warning C4700: local variable 'clr' used without having been initialized

2002-08-28  Bernhard Held <bernhard@bernhardheld.de>
	* src/SDCCglue.c (printIvalArray): iterative calculation of array length

2002-08-28  Jesus Calvino-Fraga and Borut Razem <borut.razem@siol.net>

	  sdcc/src/mcs51/mcs51.dsp, sdcc/src/pic/pic.dsp, sdcc/src/z80/z80.dsp,
	  sdcc/src/xa51/xa51.dsp, sdcc/src/avr/avra.dsp,
	  sdcc/src/ds390/ds390a.dsp, sdcc/src/mcs51/mcs51a.dsp,
	  sdcc/src/pic/pica.dsp, sdcc/src/z80/z80a.dsp,
	  sdcc/src/xa51/xa51a.dsp, sdcc/as/as_z80.dsp,
	  sdcc/as/aslink.dsp, sdcc/as/asx8051.dsp, sdcc/packihx/packihx.dsp:
	- added Release configuration in VS projects
	- review of compiler an linker options
	- VC .exe files are generated in bin_vc directory, not to interfere
	  with binaries generated from other projects (cygwin, mingw, bcc ...)

	* sdcc/src/yacc.dsp: added

	* sdcc/config.dsp, sdcc/configure_vc.awk, sdcc/sdcc_vc_in.h:
	added - genarate sdcc_vc.h using sdcc_vc_in.h as template
	and insert the version number definitions from .version 

	* sdcc/support/cpp2/sdcpp.dsp: added - VC project for sdcpp

2002-08-25  Bernhard Held <bernhard@bernhardheld.de>
	* support/scripts/inc2h.pl: use gputils or gpasm (from Nathan Hurst)

2002-08-11  Borut Razem <borut.razem@siol.net>
	* support/Util/NewAlloc.c: removed unneeded #include "sdccconf.h" (suggested by Jesus Calvino-Fraga)

2002-08-10  Borut Razem <borut.razem@siol.net>
	* src/SDCCmain.c (main):
	file preOutName was unlinked before closed. This seems to be OK on UNIX and cygwin
	platforms, but it doesn't work with Visual Studio: the opened file can not be removed.
	The consequence was that some temporary files were not removed.

	* src/SDCCglue.c:
	unification of code in functions tempfilename() and tempfile():
	function tempnam() is defined in Visual Studio 6.0 and .NET

	* sdcc/sdcc.dsw: removed project sdcpp, added project xa51a

	* sdcc/src/src.dsp, sdcc/src/avr/avr.dsp, sdcc/src/ds390/ds390.dsp,
	  sdcc/src/mcs51/mcs51.dsp, sdcc/src/pic/pic.dsp, sdcc/src/z80/z80.dsp:
	- removed compiler command line option /WX: Treats all warnings as errors
	- update a list of source files, included into the project

	* sdcc/src/avr/avra.dsp, sdcc/src/ds390/ds390a.dsp, sdcc/src/mcs51/mcs51a.dsp,
	  sdcc/src/pic/pica.dsp, sdcc/src/z80/z80a.dsp:
	changed project type to Generic Project so that can be correcly converted to VS.NET project

	* sdcc/as/mcs51/asm.h: definition of PATH_MAX for MSC

	* sdcc/src/SDCCast.c: solved MSC error in function decorateType()

	* sdcc/src/SDCC.y: added missing ending ';' to rules to get rid of bison warnings

	* dcc/src/ds390/ralloc.c, sdcc/src/mcs51/ralloc.c:
	added return 0 statements after assert() to make compiler happy

	* sdcc/src/xa51/peeph.rul, sdcc/src/xa51/peeph.def, sdcc/src/z80/ralloc.c:
	added newline in the def file to keep MSC compiler satisfied

	* sdcc/src/z80/gen.c:
	- function strcasecmp() is not defined in MSC (and probably also in BORLANDC),
	  so it is replaced with STRCASECMP, which is defined as stricmp in case of MSC and BORLANDC
	- solved MSC error in function aopDump()

	* sdcc_vc.h: define PREFIX as "\\sdcc"

2002-07-18  Bernhard Held <bernhard@bernhardheld.de>
	* src/SDCCast.c (decorateType): fixed access to array of structures http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=902690&forum_id=4107

	singly-used registers optimized away)

	* src/pic/pcoderegs.[ch]: Added new files for pCode live-range analysis

	* support/scripts/inc2h.pl Kevin L. Pauba <klpauba@cox.net> submitted this perl script for converting MicroChip include files into SDCC Pic include files.
	
2002-05-10  Scott Dattalo <scott@dattalo.com>

	Compiler generated registers for interrupt context saving
	were not getting allocated.
		
2002-03-16  Sandeep Dutta  <sandeep@ddi.com>

	* /src/SDCCast.c:
	Fixed left shift. Will promote the left side of a left shift
	if a) left shifting more than size of operand or b) when assigned
	to something size > size of left side

2002-03-14  Scott Dattalo <scott@dattalo.com>

	rewritten. Added customization for the various PICs. Flow
	analysis is restructured. ...

	* src/pic/device.h:
	Added

2002-02-21  Sandeep Dutta  <sandeep@ddi.com>

	* sdcc/src/SDCCloop.c:
	Previous fix was not good. basic blocks that have "break" or "return" are
	not really partof a loop , but live ranges used in these blocks should
	be live thru the entire loop, so set partOfLoop but don't add them to
	loop region
